## Analysis

Trough analyzing high-level(고급) and basic(기본) code, there are a little difference in them.

Put simply, there are three parts of difference, data augmentation, model architecture and evaluation results(it is not a differece essentially).

Thus, I modify the some code to decide data augmentation is turned on or not. Second, to change the model architecture. Last, to show the evaluation results or not when precessing of training in each epoch.

## Code

The experiment code [here]().

## Experiments

### E-01

```text
dataset = "flower"
# model of 기본
model architecture = "fashion"
data augmentation = Flase
```

### E-02

```text
dataset = "fashion"
# model of 고급
model architecture = "flower"
data augmentation = True
```
